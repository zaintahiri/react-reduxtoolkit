Installing react-redux and @reduxjs/toolkit
To use Redux in a React project, you need to install the necessary packages. Follow these steps:

1. Install Redux Packages
Run the following command in your React project:

sh
Copy code
npm install @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
or, if you're using Yarn:

sh
Copy code
yarn add @reduxjs/toolkit react-redux
2. Verify Installation
Once installed, check your package.json file. You should see:

json
Copy code
"dependencies": {
  "@reduxjs/toolkit": "^latest-version",
  "react-redux": "^latest-version"
}
3. What These Packages Do
@reduxjs/toolkit (RTK) → The official, recommended way to write Redux logic. It simplifies setup and state management.
react-redux → Provides React bindings for Redux, allowing components to connect to the store.
4. Next Steps
Set Up Redux Store (store.js)
Create Slices for State Management
Use Provider to Connect Redux with React
Use useSelector and useDispatch Hooks for Accessing State







# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript and enable type-aware lint rules. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.
